  ## Description 
  
  This project allows a user to create a readme using the command line on their computer. The user will be given a list of questions to answer. Their answers will be displayed on a readme file that can be copied to github or to another readme file. This will allow a user to spend more time to work on the task at hand instead of worrying about formatting a README file.
